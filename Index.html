        <ol>
            <li>First we create a sample.txt document (name is optional)</li>
            <li>now lets create crontask.sh</li>

    <h3>Create a script that takes an input (letter or number) that will display the answer of a question.
        The script should when started list a menu for the user with the different questions that can be
        chosen and which corresponding letter the user will have to give as input to display the answer of
        the desired question. One of the possible inputs the user should be able to make is "q" for quitting
        the script. The menu should also have a default case where all the items is displayed again, or no
        changes is made if the user gives an invalid input. Hint: use a switch case to be able to handle the
        menu. Each option in the menu should lead to an echo of the answer</h3>
